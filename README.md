## hi! 👋 I’m Gem Win Cañete

i’m a 4th year computer science student specializing in artificial intelligence at  
**west visayas state university**.

i like building things that are useful, simple, and nice to look at. lately, i’ve been working on  
**mobile apps**, learning about **ai agents**, and doing a bit of **ui/ux design**.
