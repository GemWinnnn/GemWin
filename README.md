# hi! 👋 i'm Gem Win Cañete (Gwen)

I'm a fourth-year computer science student at west visayas state university, specializing in artificial intelligence. most of my time goes into building things that feel useful and look clean—lately that's been mobile apps, experimenting with ai agents, and dabbling in ui/ux design. i like using ai to bridge the gap between "this would be cool" and "okay this actually works."

## what i work with

i build frontends with flutter, swift, and react. on the backend side, i stick to python and c++. for databases i use firebase, and i deploy stuff on vercel and render.

## what i'm learning

right now i'm trying to get better at understanding ai concepts beyond surface-level usage, managing sql databases properly, and making frontends that don't just work but actually feel nice to use.
